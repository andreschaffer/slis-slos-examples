# SLIs and SLOs examples

# Motivation
How reliable is the service you provide to your customers? What would be a _good enough_ reliability level for your service? And what would change in how you work with software development if reliability was a feature?  
There is a lot of material out there about SLIs and SLOs, but to me these three simple questions reveal the essence of it.  

In this project I will share a practical example of working with these concepts. I will try and keep it short and to the point, and recommend reading [Google's SRE book](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives) if one wants to learn the subject more in depth.
