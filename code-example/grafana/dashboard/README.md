# Dashboard

The layout of the dashboard provides this info:
- Ticket and Page Alerts
- Availability and Latency SLIs/SLOs
- Traffic for some quick correlation with how the application is doing

Additional info, for example for troubleshooting the application, are recommended to live in a separate dashboard.
